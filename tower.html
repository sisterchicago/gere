            Known as the Sears Tower until 2009, The Willis Tower was the world's tallest building until 1998. However, its rich history began many years before that. Here are some interesting historical facts about The Willis Tower:

        <p class="para">
            In 2009, when Sears became Willis, the Skydeck was completely revamped. Instead of being a 103rd floor lookout point, visitors are now able to step into windows that extend from the building, offering views straight down over the city of Chicago! <img class="down" src="willis/down.jpeg" alt="Looking Down">They say the inspiration for The Ledge came from hundreds of forehead prints left behind on the Skydeck windows each week, just like in Ferris Bueller's Day off!
            <br>
            <br>
            The Ledge is 1,353 feet and 103 stories up. It is the highest observation deck in the United States. It is made of three layers of half-inch thick glass laminated into one seamless unit. It's built to withstand four tons of pressure and can hold 10,000 lbs!
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the best part of The Ledge is that on a clear day, views can span 50 miles and four states: Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan! I guess there are some advantages to living in the flat lands!
